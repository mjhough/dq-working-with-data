There appears to be a much higher number of males at schools that
are a part of a juvenile justice facility or youth prison, when compared
to women.

Magnet schools seem to have almost the same amount of males and females
as a percentage. Although there are more male students in magnet schools,
there are also more males in the total. Accounting for this, gives an almost
equal value for each gender.
